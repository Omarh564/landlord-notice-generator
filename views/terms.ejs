        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p>
          These terms and conditions govern your use of the Landlord Notice Generator
          website and services. By accessing or using our service you agree to be
          bound by these terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then
          you may not access the service.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of Service</h2>
        <p>
          You may use this service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with
          these terms. You agree not to misuse our service or attempt to access
          it using a method other than the interface and instructions that we
          provide.
        </p>
        <h2>Payments & Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          All payments are processed securely via Stripe. We offer pay‑per‑notice
          pricing as well as optional subscription plans. Due to the digital
          nature of the documents, all sales are final and non‑refundable once
          the notice has been generated.
        </p>
        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          The documents generated through this service are based on official
          government templates and are provided for informational purposes only.
          We are not a law firm and do not provide legal advice. Users should
          consult a qualified solicitor to ensure the notices meet their specific
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these terms from time to time. We will notify you of any
          changes by posting the new terms on this page. You are advised to
          review this page periodically for any changes.
