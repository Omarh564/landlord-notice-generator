          <h3>Is this service legal?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. We use official UK government templates for each notice type.
            However, we are not a law firm and do not provide legal advice. You
            should review the documents carefully and consult a solicitor if you
            have any questions about your specific situation.

          <h3>How quickly will I get my notice?</h3>
          <p>
            Immediately after completing your payment you will be able to
            download your PDF notice. The process takes just a few minutes from
            start to finish.

          <h3>Do I need an account?</h3>
          <p>
            No account is required. Simply choose your notice type, enter the
            necessary details, pay securely via Stripe and download your
            document.

          <h3>Can I edit the notice after downloading?</h3>
          <p>
            The PDF notice is generated based on the information you provide.
            You should review your entries carefully before payment. If you
            notice a mistake, you can simply start a new notice and only pay
            when you're ready to download.
