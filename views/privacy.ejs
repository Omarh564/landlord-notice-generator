        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
          We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal
          data. This policy explains how we collect, use and safeguard the
          information you provide when using our service.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We collect the information you submit via our forms, such as names,
          addresses and tenancy details. We also collect payment information
          through our payment processor, Stripe. Payment details are handled
          exclusively by Stripe and are not stored on our servers.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>
          We use your information solely to generate the requested notice and to
          process your payment. We do not sell or share your personal data with
          third parties, except as required to provide our services (e.g.,
          payment processing) or comply with legal obligations.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to
          safeguard your information. However, no method of transmission over the
          internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You may request access to, correction of or deletion of your personal
          data at any time. To exercise these rights, please contact us via the
          email address provided on our website.
